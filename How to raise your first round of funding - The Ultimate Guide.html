 it seems you want to raise capital. For most people, this decision 
isn’t taken with a lot of thought behind it -- you see others raising 
money and you feel an urgent need to do the same or you feel like you’re
 left behind. I’ve raised money three times in my life, for two separate
 companies. The first two times were well thought out, the most recent 
time was me “going with the flow” rather than a well thought out funding
 round -- it also happened to be the most amount of capital we have 
raised.<br></p><p>I’m writing this note to myself and anyone else who 
might be preparing to raise, and will be going through all the nitty 
gritties of completing a successful fund raise. A lot of what I will 
describe here is “insider information”, in the sense that only people 
privy to the way the indian VC/startup ecosystem works will know this. 
But I am your unfair advantage, so it is my duty to break the veil open 
for you.<br></p><p>Firstly, what are the different types of rounds? 
These “stages” of rounds reflect where the company is in its journey. 
Here is the rough breakdown:<br></p><p><strong>Pre-Seed:</strong> 100-500k, Idea stage</p><p><strong>Seed: </strong>500k-3 Million, Initial product stage</p><p><strong>Pre-Series A:</strong>
 1 Million-3 Million (there is an overlap between Seed and Pre-Series A,
 you can call it whatever as long as it is in this range); early signal 
of Product Market Fit, some evidence that the market loves and uses your
 product, at least a segment of the market</p><p><strong>Series A:</strong> 3 Million+, Strong signal of Product Market Fit - the market loves and uses the product, it fills a need</p><p><strong>Series B:</strong> Usually 10 Million+, Proven PMF, Scaling like crazy</p><p><strong>Series C, D, E:</strong> Variable, Mature startup with a huge user/customer base<br></p><p>The
 types of investors in these different rounds also varies: pre-seed 
investors are typically angels, seed investors are either institutional 
funds (who also raise money from other investors) or angels, and 
Pre-Series A, Series A and beyond are typically institutional investors.
 While angels can write checks and don’t really care much because it is 
their own money, institutional investors raise external capital from 
high net worth individuals, angels, and other funds (they call these 
external investors Limited Partners, or LPs for short). The problem with
 them raising from LPs is that they have to write lengthy reports, do 
due diligence (proper background check on the company), and justify 
their decisions to their LPs later, so it is naturally harder to raise 
from them. <br></p><p>Since most people reading this will be raising a 
pre-seed or seed round first, this newsletter will cover that stage of 
fundraising. We’ll ignore the later rounds for now. I’m going to break 
down the fundraising process into 2 broad steps: Outline, and Depth.<br></p><h2 id="stage-1-outline">Stage 1: Outline<br></h2><p>At the surface level (first meeting), most investors have 4 primary questions about the business. </p><ol><li>Story</li><li>Traction</li><li>Team</li><li>Market</li></ol><p>In an investor’s head, you need to check off these 4 boxes to proceed to the next level. <br><br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/IBlbLfLyLoQVE5adrsNahXBaxGVtRooYpB5ej1bfn-vMHXJ2fD5a53QPn3Eq.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>Story</strong><br></p><p>Generally
 at the Seed stages, you need to have a strong story, or a “why” of your
 business. Why did you get into this? Why did you see a need to build 
this business? How is it special to you versus, say, running a 
restaurant? And money of course, is not a good answer to this question. 
Most individuals at this stage invest in passionate entrepreneurs 
building good products who really care about what they are doing.<br></p><p><strong>Traction</strong><br></p><p>The
 next obvious question is whether you have any users or customers for 
your product. This stage is tricky in the sense that if you have built 
something valuable before, investors are willing to completely overlook 
traction for a new project. If you are new to the ecosystem, investors 
are more likely to want to see good traction. Remember, this is the 
first meeting, so they aren’t really going to dive into details -- they 
just want to see surface level data and whether what you have built has 
some value to your user base.<br></p><p><strong>Team</strong></p><p><br>A
 good team signals two things: One, that the founders can convince other
 solid people to join them on their mission, and two, that the product 
can actually be built and reach where it has to. Remember that there is 
usually a gap between the story that is told and the product that 
exists. The story is one of an ideal world where the product gets big, 
but the reality is that the product is probably at version 0.1. It will 
take years before this happens and you need a good team to pull it off. 
What will mostly be measured is if the team has the domain experience to
 solve this: It would be rare to see a construction engineer solve a 
climate change problem or a climate change expert solve a skincare 
problem. Although, there is one major exception - Computer Science 
Engineers In the last ten years, this one category of engineers have 
proven they can take on any problem in any domain and win. It is less 
because they are skilled, but more because computer science is a force 
multiplier in any domain. Even if they know less about the particular 
domain, adding computer technology and internet access to it allows it 
to scale to millions of users, so the potential revenue is always 
higher. For example, you can make the best jeans but it's a much better 
business to make an online store where all the jean makers can sell 
their jeans at different prices and to a larger audience. The headache 
of producing each item is with the vendors but your one time scalability
 has the potential to reach a household at the other end of your nation;
 that's how powerful CS and the internet is. <br></p><blockquote>One 
important clarification here; when I use the words “Computer Science 
Engineer”, I don’t mean those who have passed out of college and hold a 
degree. <strong>I mean anyone who can code.</strong> People who can 
engineer a solution using Computer Science, it's that simple. My 
definition of something does not have anything to do with a degree. 
&nbsp;<br></blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/ymy6UwjnTFGZVp42Xz_7C3wBFB285j6c6ddgCwuIrGJu30_TwtC4BfznjgyF.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>Market</strong><br></p><p>The
 final thing that investors want to see is whether the market is big 
enough. Let’s take our own example -- when we built Scenes and realized 
that it works, the next question is “How many people would it work 
for?”. The answer is roughly 100 million English speaking people in 
India. We know this because LinkedIn has 80 million English speakers in 
India, and another 10-20 million kids who are still in an English medium
 school or college. That is the ceiling of what we can reach.</p><p>Similarly,
 if you start an Uber for Dogs (a service to allow people to book cars 
to transport dogs), even if it works at a small scale, nobody will 
invest in it. The main reason is that the market for such a service is 
tiny! The number of people in India who would book a cab purely for 
their dog is very, very small. Investors want to bet big -- the venture 
funding game is an all or nothing game. If you want to build a small 
business, bootstrap is the way to go.</p><p>Let’s assume the investor 
likes your pitch so far and wants to dive deeper. The next step is more 
grueling and takes longer -- usually 2-5 months.<br></p><h2 id="stage-2-diving-deeper">Stage 2: Diving Deeper<br></h2><p>This
 step takes place over several meetings (over several weeks to months). 
The smaller the round, the faster it closes. The larger the quantum, the
 more time it takes. The more investors in the round, the more time it 
takes. The less known you are, the more time it takes. <br></p><p>To 
give you context: our last round, which had 27 investors, took 2 months 
to close. This is despite the fact that we already knew most of the 
investors beforehand.<br></p><p>Investors at this stage will want to have these questions answered:<br></p><ol><li><strong>Are the founders full time?</strong>
 If not, chances of raising are not that high. Investors want to see 
commitment to a project and personal risk taken. Who would give you 
money if you are already employed and doing this on the side?<br><br></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Is this venture scalable?</strong></strong></strong>
 Is this the next Facebook (with a billion user market), or an Uber for 
Dogs, with a market of 20,000 people? Investors, especially 
institutional investors, have a goal: they invest in companies that have
 a potential of returning their entire fund size. For example, if the VC
 firm itself raised 200 million dollars in their round, they need to 
invest in companies that can sell for at least 200 million dollars. The 
reason for this is that 9/10 VC bets fail. So there needs to be at least
 one company among their bets that can get really really big and make up
 for the losses on the others. Small bets are automatically shut off.<br><br></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Is there a moat? </strong></strong></strong>A
 moat is a question of defensibility. Remember Tiktok? When TikTok came 
out and did well, there were thousands of clones. What advantage did 
Tiktok have over the others apart from their brand? Is it a 
technological defensive point (like AI) or a community defensive point 
(like Avalon’s Army)? Either way, companies that get big without a moat 
have a risk of dying to generic clones.<br><br></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Do we have a pre-existing relationship with this company? </strong></strong></strong>Avalon
 is not fundraising right now, but that doesn’t stop us from continually
 meeting new VCs and chronically giving them updates. What you 
absolutely don’t want is to have a great product but have no 
pre-existing relationships with funds or angels. It’s hard to build a 
relationship and trust with someone in a few days. Typically you need at
 least a few people in the round you know well, and hope that they give 
you warm introductions to other investors. <br>The good thing is that 
when you are building something nice and active on Twitter (not 
Instagram or Tiktok), VC analysts will reach out to you. Analysts have a
 job role that involves them scouting for interesting companies and 
keeping tabs on their progress. It’s a good idea to build relationships 
with these analysts and keep them in the loop (think of it as content 
marketing). <br><br></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Is this company safe to invest in? </strong></strong></strong>VCs
 run a process called due diligence in parallel with their talks with 
you. In this process, they check your incorporation and legal status, 
and also talk with a few people you have worked with in the past (which 
is why it is important to keep good relationships with your old 
co-workers). Finally, they will talk to a few of your users to see if 
their feedback matches up with the story you have told the VC. What will
 be valuable to create at this point is a Due Diligence document, which I
 will cover in a bit.<br><br></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Who else is investing? </strong></strong></strong>I’ve
 made a parody video on this a long time ago, but this is how it really 
works. It is hard to make an investment decision in a company, you will 
usually not know much about how it works or how it is run. A good signal
 that it might be a good investment is if other well known investors 
jump in the loop. The more such investors who are subscribing to your 
round, the more new investors who jump on in the bid to not be left out.
 Of the three times I’ve raised capital, the third one was a “hot 
round”, where we were oversubscribed (too many investors, too few 
slots), and had to leave some investors out and disappointed. <br>This 
is why I say that the most critical thing to have is a few good 
investors who commit first, and the round momentum builds up as you get 
more such people involved.<br><br></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Is there social proof that this works? </strong></strong></strong>Looking
 at other investors is one thing, but is there buzz from users about 
this startup? Are people on Twitter talking about it? (the reason I 
mention Twitter is because most analysts are on twitter). <br><br></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Traction </strong>Finally, what does the data say? </strong></strong>There
 are a few metrics that VCs want to see, depending on the type of 
startup you are. I will be making a very long post in the coming weeks 
about these metrics (including our own and what are good benchmarks); 
but will also be running you through them briefly in a bit.<br><br></li></ol><p>The
 best way to tackle these questions is to “pre-answer” them for the VCs.
 That means that you create the right documentation and decks for them 
to read whenever they want, instead of interrogating you. That way, you 
only have to pitch the outline (Stage 1), and your documents allow them 
to go deeper later without asking you.<br></p><h2 id="the-documents">The Documents<br></h2><p>Here are the documents that Avalon puts together to pre-answer those questions.<br></p><p><strong>1. <strong><strong>A pitch deck</strong></strong></strong></p><p>This
 is an overview of the outline that we spoke about before, with some 
deeper answers on metrics embedded inside. A pitch deck is a visual 
representation of your story and charts -- don’t bore people with too 
much text or going too far in depth. These will usually be circulated 
over email and nobody has the patience to read through 50 slides, 
especially when cold contacted. VCs will also circulate this deck to all
 their LPs. The best pitch decks to model around are the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/MathildeCollin/front-series-a-deck-64596550?ref=https://cdn.embedly.com/">FrontApp </a>deck and the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/metrics1/mixpanel-our-pitch-deck-that-we-used-to-raise-65m">Mixpanel Deck</a>.
 While they’re not seed stage decks, the structure is the same -- and 
they’re very well done! This deck should be sent before your meeting.<br></p><p><strong>2. <strong><strong>A Product Vision document</strong></strong></strong></p><p>This
 is where you should go in depth, and what you should send to investors 
after your first meeting. Feel free to go in depth explaining what you 
are building, why it is different, and where it lies compared to the 
competition.</p><p><strong>3. <strong><strong>A Data document</strong></strong></strong></p><p>This
 is where you describe all the traction you have seen so far, including 
your downloads, sign ups, activated users, retention, daily and monthly 
active users, net promoter score, k-factor, churn, attribution, and 
revenue. We’ll go over all of these metrics and more in a later post. 
These metrics might change depending on what your business is.<br></p><p><strong>4. <strong><strong>Cap table</strong></strong></strong></p><p>The
 cap table is a list of who has invested and what percentage of the 
company each investor and founder owns. At the seed stage, the ideal 
amount of dilution to have is 17-22%, and 10% of the company is reserved
 for employee stock options (also called ESOP pool). So founders should 
end up with 65-80% of the company after the round. VCs don’t typically 
invest in solo founders, so make sure you have co-founders you can count
 on.<br></p><p>Let’s assume a fund/angel has taken interest in your 
company and loves your documents and vision. The next step is to 
actually get the round closed. With angels, this is easy -- if they 
verbally say “yes”, then you are done for now. With a VC, it is a little
 more tricky.<br></p><p>You see, VCs actually have a hierarchy of power 
inside the fund. Analysts (sometimes just titled “Investors” on 
LinkedIn) &nbsp;are the guys/girls who scout for companies and go 
through your documents. If they like your company, they typically 
arrange a meeting for you and a Partner. A Partner is the person who 
will lead you round and will also sit on your board (I’ll make a post 
about board dynamics later). If a partner likes you, he will arrange a 
meeting with you and an investment committee (also called an IC). The IC
 is basically a group of all the influential people in a fund, who vote 
on whether to invest in a business or not. <br></p><blockquote>Sidenote:
 At the seed stage, most people in the IC don’t all agree via consensus 
on whether to invest or not -- there is simply not enough data. 
Therefore for sub 1 Million dollar rounds, most Partners in the top 5 VC
 firms in India can take solo decisions. They only need IC approval for 
bigger check sizes. <br></blockquote><p>If an IC has said yes to you, or
 a partner has made a unilateral decision to invest, then the next stage
 is a termsheet. A termsheet runs through all the basic terms of the 
deal. With termsheets, the shorter the better. At this point, you get 
all the funds and angels to sign off on this, and the final process is 
to encode the short termsheet into a long Shareholder’s agreement. All 
of this will be done by your lawyers and fairly standard, so no stress 
here.</p><p>And...that’s it! The money will be wired into your bank account, and at this point you are a funded company. Happy operating :)</p>
